# Amphibian Skin 16S Nanopore Microbiome Against Woodhams Data Base of Bd-Inhibitory-taxa
In this repository you will find

a) Woodhams Data Base : Woodhams, Douglas & Alford, Ross & Antwis, Rachael & Archer, Holly & Becker, Matthew & Belden, Lisa & Bell, Sara & Bletz, Molly & Daskin, Joshua & Davis, Leyla & Flechas, Sandra & Lauer, Antje & Gonz√°lez, Antonio & Harris, Reid & Holden, Whitney & Hughey, Myra & Nez, Roberto & Knight, Rob & Kueneman, Jordan & McKenzie, Valerie. (2015). Antifungal isolates database of amphibian skin-associated bacteria and function against emerging fungal pathogens Ecological Archives E096-059. Ecology. 96. 2015-595. doi:10.1890/14-1837.1.

b) Personal R script to analyze the proportion of the community (based on taxa counts) and the fraction of the community (based on relative abundance) with putative inhibition to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) growth is found in Amphibian skin microbiome samples and the surrounding environment, using minimap2 to map nanopore sequences and finally, to generate a publication plot.


### First time done using 16S nanopore sequencing data
NOTE: Nanopore reads processing and taxonomic assignation was done previously using Spaghetti pipeline: https://github.com/adlape95/Spaghetti
